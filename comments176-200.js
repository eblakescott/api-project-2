Rather than Republic No. 1, as he asserts, we are actually on Republic No. 2, since the Republic of the Articles of Confederation (in effect de jure from 1781-1789) was quite different than the Republic of the Constitution of 1787 (in effect from 1789 to present). Under the Articles of Confederation our central government was rather weak and did not have a separate executive branch. How weak you might ask? For starters, it had no power to tax and had to rely on 1) printing money (which in excess led to a high rate of inflation), 2) money raised and contributed by each individual state (which could withhold funds with impunity), and 3) borrowing money (difficult without a French deus ex machina). I could go on and on (others have, however this is a letter not a book), but my point is made. The two central governments were quite different, and that fact justifies my correction that our current Republic, long may it last, is our second one.","approveDate":"1373040307","recommendations":2,"replies":[],"editorsSelection":false,"times_people":1,"sharing":0,"email_status":"0","display_name":"Gerald Ottenbreit Jr","location":"Dearborn, MI","userComments":"api.nytimes.com\/svc\/community\/v2\/comments\/user\/id\/59438254.xml"},{"status":"approved","commentSequence":290,"userTitle":"NULL","userURL":"NULL","commentTitle":"n\/a","commentBody":"Of course, in referring to \"men\" the Founders limited themselves not just to \"whites\" but also, well, to men -- not women.
