But after having lived through the past 60 years, I am not so sure.  The hypocrisy in our government and economy seems overwhelming.<br\/><br\/>Despite what the politicians say, our government seems to be less and less responsive to the needs of the country.  Every politician seems to be interested only in their own agenda which consists of the needs of the people who brought them to power.  They talk about the power of the vote and then look for ways to block their opponents' supporters from the polls.  They pay lip service to our returning veterans and then cut funds for the department that is supposed to support those same veterans.  They support democracy while our nation is being run by a congress that represents less than half of the people.<br\/><br\/>Despite what the politicians say, our economy seems to be evolving more and more into a feudal system in which there are a small number of overlords and a great number of poorly treated serfs.  I read about the growing disparity between the rich and the rest of us.  I read about the hardening of the class structure and how there is less and less opportunity for climbing out of the class into which a child is born. And, while the cards are stacked against them, I see politicians and others blame the unemployed for their condition. <br\/><br\/>I wanted to celebrate the Fourth, I did, but I really couldn't.","approveDate":"1373034667","recommendations":21,"replies":[],"editorsSelection":false,"times_people":1,"sharing":0,"email_status":"0","display_name":"Joseph Thomas","location":"Falls Church, VA","userComments":"api.nytimes.com\/svc\/community\/v2\/comments\/user\/id\/40397396.xml"},{"status":"approved","commentSequence":30,"userTitle":"NULL","userURL":"NULL","commentTitle":"n\/a","commentBody":"The hot dogs are rancid.

America is, indeed, a great and wondrous nation, and I am certainly glad I live here.<br\/><br\/>But I see serious fissures in our heretofore solid societal foundation:<br\/><br\/>1. The growing income disparity, which has enormous implications for policy choices, since the wealthy control the levers of power and create (or oppose) legislation that always takes care of their interests, and not the rest of us.<br\/><br\/>2. The ominous, relentless assault by those who want the United States to be a Christian nation.  Their misunderstanding of the concept of the separation of church and state results in constant battles among politicians over silly issues like Ten Commandments displays in county courthouses and, more seriously, the ongoing demonization of women's rights.<br\/><br\/>3. Growing, widespread disbelief in government. Americans are increasingly estranged from the political process, as well as from those who \"lead\" us.<br\/><br\/>4. A dysfunctional health care system that grows worse even as the number of people who need essential health care continues to expand with the aging baby boomer cohort.<br\/><br\/>5. Our propensity to equate \"freedom\" with self-aggrandizement.  Look at what we eat, and the almost complete lack of food health and safety standards.  Look at our gun culture. <br\/><br\/>Paul Krugman, for years, has been the canary in the mine shaft.  But are we truly grasping his warnings, and acting upon them?

Life has been so good in America that we have forgotten just how valuable our rights are under the constitution; we've forgotten the sacrifices that were made to win them. Without any major threat in recent memory to the notion of what it means to be an American, we've come to take our freedoms for granted, as though whatever decision we make politically will not diminish who we are.<br\/><br\/>When you've haven't been stung by the bee in a while, you may come to think you can never be stung.<br\/><br\/>We are getting stung by a growing and menacing surveillance state, and yet most still act as if if they don't even know it. The latest to come out from behind the curtain is the Mail Isolation Control and Tracking program\u200f: a program that takes a picture of every piece of mail sent and received in this country. But with each revelation that their unalienable rights are being compromised, Americans continue to be ho-hum about it!
