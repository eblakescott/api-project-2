In 1855 Walt Whitman promulgated an ecstatic and exalted vision of democracy  in "song of Myself." Several decades later in his "democratic Vistas" he descended into despair when confronted with the crass reality of social division, greed, the ascent of the robber barons which dashed the optimism he nurtured in 1855. These two works of a great American writer mirror the statements of Dr. Krugman and Mr. James. To my great chagrin I must side with Mr. James.</commentBody><approveDate>1373034183</approveDate><recommendations>43</recommendations><replies/><editorsSelection>Y</editorsSelection><times_people>1</times_people><sharing>0</sharing><email_status>0</email_status><display_name>gpd</display_name><location>Riverdale New York</location><userComments>api.nytimes.com/svc/community/v2/comments/user/id/23271686.xml</userComments></comment><comment><status>approved</status><commentSequence>1</commentSequence><userTitle>NULL</userTitle><userURL>NULL</userURL><commentTitle>n/a</commentTitle><commentBody>Hi, Mom.

Despite our national obsession with ethnicity, America has never been about the genetic makeup of its people. America is an idea, an idea so powerful that, despite the successive prejudices of its people, manages to overcome those, calling us (often messily and noisily) to transcend our own limitations and biases. <br/><br/>As Dr Krugman says, the government instituted by the Constitution may be the oldest such regime in the world, but it is the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights that defines the American, and the ideas in those documents know no racial distinctions. They are a new Gospel of what it means to be human, and it is that civil religion that defines and unites us, even with the occasional spat over whether some demographic has legitimate claim to its protections.]]></commentBody><approveDate>1373024587</approveDate><recommendations>117</recommendations><replies><comments/><offset>0</offset></replies><editorsSelection>Y</editorsSelection><times_people>1</times_people><sharing>0</sharing><email_status>0</email_status><display_name>Kurt</display_name><location>NY</location><userComments>api.nytimes.com/svc/community/v2/comments/user/id/55563058.xml</userComments></comment><comment><status>approved</status><commentSequence>21</commentSequence><userTitle>NULL</userTitle><userURL>NULL</userURL><commentTitle>n/a</commentTitle><commentBody><![CDATA[In many of the outward symbols, we are the same democracy that Jefferson and friends created.

But mostly, it happened because John Roberts, Sam Alito and three other men who have no idea what democracy actually means, handed power and authority to those with money in a relentless series of decisions that saps the very essence of "E Pluribus Unum" from the nation as the Court overturns every bit of progress made since the 1950s.<br/><br/>On July 4, I mourned for my country rather than blowing off fireworks or singing faux patriotic songs.

I have great faith in democracy and that our special three division of powers acts as cooling systems for all the hot ideas that might be championed.  This brings to mind George Washington giving a speech to the War of Independence Army, who were threatening to mutiny over veterans benefits after the war, demanding them immediately as they would from a king.<br/><br/>George Washington, knowing about the theater part of politics called all the men together for this speech.  He walked out appearing a bit arthritic.  Unfolded his paper and appeared to focus his eyes.  Then dramatically calling out something to the affect of "my eyes have grown weak in service to this democracy". The soldiers cried and beat their chest not a dry eye in the house and they didn't burn down the capital.  Instead the bill was introduced into the congress.<br/><br/>Talking about the state of our nation.  I am a bit frightened by the call for cuts in spending and smaller government and the influence of the super-rich..  As there are plenty of examples of small government with minimal public services in the world and it looks totally miserable.  <br/><br/>For all it's flaws the USA seems to excel at governance and taxing to provide adequate public services while keeping corruption down to a dull roar.  I believe our government is more  flexible and more preferable to any other government system.  ]]></commentBody><approveDate>1373032689</approveDate><recommendations>49</recommendations><replies/><editorsSelection>Y</editorsSelection><times_people>1</times_people><sharing>0</sharing><email_status>0</email_status><display_name>chrisv</display_name><location>green bay</location><userComments>api.nytimes.com/svc/community/v2/comments/user/id/66442345.xml</userComments></comment><comment><status>approved</status><commentSequence>64</commentSequence><userTitle>NULL</userTitle><userURL>NULL</userURL><commentTitle>n/a</commentTitle><commentBody><![CDATA[Another irony worthy of note on July 4th is how our system of privately paid for elections compares to the systems of most other advanced countries--those in 'old Europe'. and other continents.  They have publicly financed elections, which does a lot to prevent legalized bribery of their govts. Their TV air time is free to all candidates. Also they have run offs for the top 2 winners, enabling more points of view to get heard, and voters to express their preferences.  <br/><br/>While we celebrate our Independence from our former colonizers, recall that our S. Court says corporations are people with free speech rights paid for in dollars.<br/><br/>Our votes are in effect nullified by the pull of huge concentrations of wealth and power. We thus choose between the candidates paid for by the powerful, and who can operate only between the parameters the powerful set up. If they depart too much, they don’t get nominated. Thus Obama—great speeches, then appoints Wall St for his cabinet. <br/><br/>The congress of millionaires we elect enabled vast wealth accumulation by the top corporations. Our resources flowed up to the 1 percent.  The control over our laws and elections is quite complete. Let’s contemplate this as we celebrate our Independence from King George.  ]]></commentBody><approveDate>1373032963</approveDate><recommendations>204</recommendations><replies/><editorsSelection>Y</editorsSelection><times_people>1</times_people><sharing>0</sharing><email_status>0</email_status><display_name>Meredith</display_name><location>New York</location><userComments>api.nytimes.com/svc/community/v2/comments/user/id/28617892.xml</userComments></comment><comment><status>approved</status><commentSequence>65</commentSequence><userTitle>NULL</userTitle><userURL>NULL</userURL><commentTitle>n/a</commentTitle><commentBody><![CDATA[When I was a kid in the mid 70s, my dad would always say that America was the best country in the world.<br/><br/>This was right after Vietnam and Watergate, and I would roll my eyes.

Jefferson in particular insisted that succeeding generations would have to work out for themselves solutions for their present-day problems, with little regard for what Lincoln called the tired dogmas of the past. The desire so many of us have not only to specify what the Founders intended, but to regard that as sacred text, is utterly antithetical to the spirit of '76, and to the thinking of the Founders themselves, who let's not forget were children of the Enlightenment, as is the U.S. itself.<br/><br/>Unlike most of the rest of the world, American nationalism is not and never has been ethnically, but idea-based, ideas best embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, but particularly in the Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>Also, it follows that by definition those who regard the federal government as by nature evil are arguably the most un-American of all. Some tea partiers seem not to grasp that American nationalism, the United States itself, is a product of the federal government, that the American people, unlike other countries, did not precede the state and then created one, but was itself a product of the state's creation.<br/><br/>Americans have a healthy fear of too strong a government.
