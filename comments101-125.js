We have struggled, faltered, lurched, and stumbled our way to a more equitable society, and while we have never been able to shake completely the notion that some people are just less equal than others we at least have reduced the size of that group over the centuries.<br\/><br\/>I therefore share your optimism.  Even in times like these that we are experiencing now, when in the short term we may regress to earlier inequalities, our history compels us to have confidence in our long term prospects.  A single Abraham Lincoln, FDR, or Martin Luther King, Jr., ultimately will be more boldly woven into the fabric of our nation than a thousand Sarah Palins or Rush Limbaughs.  Some day the Tea Party and its reactionary goals will be no better remembered here than the Ku Klux Klan.","approveDate":"1373033311","recommendations":6,"replies":[],"editorsSelection":false,"times_people":1,"sharing":1,"email_status":"0","display_name":"Ken H.","location":"Athens, Alabama","userComments":"api.nytimes.com\/svc\/community\/v2\/comments\/user\/id\/54186663.xml"},{"status":"approved","commentSequence":304,"userTitle":"NULL","userURL":"NULL","commentTitle":"n\/a","commentBody":"BREAKING NEWS;  Some Southern States which were never happy with Blacks voting and was forced down their throat by Washington have plans to return things back to the good old days thanks to the Supreme Court striking down Voting Rights Act.

As the saying goes, \"the more things change, the more things stay the same.\"  <br\/><br\/>I fear that too many people have a romantic, idealized view of America -- and that includes way too many politicians (esp those on the far right).  However, the strength of this country isn't in a slavish devotion to an ideology or in an imagined past that doesn't exist , but in its ability over the years to recognize its failings, and to make the necessary changes to move toward that \"more perfect Union\" mentioned in the Preamble to the Constitution. <br\/><br\/>I'm a news junkie, and when I think the state of the Union can't get any worse, I look in on the news from 1859 or 1930 or 1963 and realize that we'll get through this, too -- BECAUSE of our system of government and our freedom of the press (and for those who think it's \"1984,\" if you can buy a copy of \"1984\" it's not 1984).","approveDate":"1373034308","recommendations":6,"replies":{"comments":[],"offset":0},"editorsSelection":false,"times_people":1,"sharing":0,"email_status":"0","display_name":"Slim1921","location":"Charlotte NC","userComments":"api.nytimes.com\/svc\/community\/v2\/comments\/user\/id\/66840187.xml"},{"status":"approved","commentSequence":37,"userTitle":"NULL","userURL":"NULL","commentTitle":"n\/a","commentBody":"Yes, we should all be grateful that we still have our ideals, because the practice of governance in recent years has run counter to them.

When America declared its independence, the people were mostly farmers and craftsmen, and enjoyed a lot of independence in their work devoid of pressure and influence.  There was a strong presence of churches, but they provided moral guidance. <br\/><br\/>Today a great deal of Americans work for big business, government and other institutions.  People are being monitored continually at work and even in their personal lives, and failure to conform can have serious consequences.  Due to fear of losing their livelihoods, many have essentially sold their souls to their employers.<br\/><br\/>So the question is how to restore self confidence among Americans.  It starts with a strong economy in which people aren't afraid to tell their employers to \"take this job and shove it\" when necessary.  And a thriving economy will enable people to thrive, which will foster gratitude instead of bitterness, leading to a more generous and moral society.","approveDate":"1373032772","recommendations":5,"replies":{"comments":[],"offset":0},"editorsSelection":false,"times_people":1,"sharing":0,"email_status":"0","display_name":"Fred Dorbsky","location":"Louisville, KY","userComments":"api.nytimes.com\/svc\/community\/v2\/comments\/user\/id\/62645834.xml"},{"status":"approved","commentSequence":299,"userTitle":"NULL","userURL":"NULL","commentTitle":"n\/a","commentBody":"Another heartwarming political analysis by Mr. Krugman.<br\/>He attacks  Palin for saying \"Real America\" which means many things to many people.<br\/>He attacks the  founding fathers.<br\/>He attacks America as\"the most class ridden nation\"<br\/>He criticizes \"the wealthy\" .<br\/>He attacks those that  he terms \"the block the vote\" people who simply support voter ids to prevent illegal votes.<br\/>To Mr. Krugman it seems,the United States is a hot dog on a soggy roll.","approveDate":"1373051543","recommendations":5,"replies":[],"editorsSelection":false,"times_people":1,"sharing":0,"email_status":"0","display_name":"jck","location":"nj","userComments":"api.nytimes.com\/svc\/community\/v2\/comments\/user\/id\/58935558.xml"},{"status":"approved","commentSequence":108,"userTitle":"NULL","userURL":"NULL","commentTitle":"n\/a","commentBody":"Dr. K., there is one huge difference.
