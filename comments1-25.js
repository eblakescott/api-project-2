On the other hand, as this section of Prof. Krugman's piece suggests, we have also grown dismayingly gullible. Too many of us toss around words with high-minded sentiments but can't see that we're being misled by people who believe precisely the opposite.  How many of us, for example, will applaud a statement made routinely by virtually every politician of either party to the effect that our men (and women) in uniform are fighting in Afghanistan- or Iraq- to defend \"our freedoms\"? In fact they're doing no such thing, unless the speaker is referring to the freedom granted to our CEOs to exploit the natural resources of underdeveloped nations. Americans are, in the main, a good and righteous people who need to open their eyes, weed out the clich\u00e9s and conventions that are no longer applicable and vote themselves a better group of congressional representatives.
