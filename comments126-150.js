The choices are based on getting what THEY want for us, and not at all necessarily what we the people want for ourselves and our progeny. <br\/><br\/>The SCOTUS has socked it to us, with undemocratic opinions that have thrown the dream of Abraham Lincoln into turmoil. They seem to have found true democracy distasteful and have delivered America foul decisions that seem to be aimed at destroying the intent of our founding fathers, who after all, were also human, and subject to all the faults of human beings. The written words of 237 yrs ago may have had different nuances than now, leading to new interpretations of what society should look like. A typical example is the furor over the  2nd amendment with the words \"...a well-regulated milita..\" now translated as any citizen can carry a concealed weapon just in case he runs into someone also carrying heat. So now, more guns exist on our land than actual people.<br\/><br\/>Much more humane were Lincoln's words: with malice for none, with charity for all. Dubya's \"compassionate conservatism\" turned out an oxymoron. Hundreds of thousands of deaths are basically his fault and wrongheadedness.<br\/><br\/>What have we done to deserve this? The answer: most of us are plain stupid, racist, or uneducated.<br\/><br\/>Here's to another 237 July 4th cookouts. Good luck to us all. We sure need it.
