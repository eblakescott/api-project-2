Continuity with what?   <br\/><br\/>George Washington's threat of a military coup produced the Constitutional convention.  it produced a government in the domestic sphere weaker than Justice Thomas imagines.   An equal number of slave and non-slave states were deliberately created so that each section would have an equal number of Senators.  This was to give the less populous South a veto in the Congress.  The President was supposed to be elected in a House runoff with one state-one vote (that is, with a Southern veto).<br\/><br\/>We did democratize in the 1820s and 1830s, but the fear engendered in the South gave us a Civil War that killed 600,000 people.  In 1876 we did away with the democracy and the Northern victory in the Civil War. For over 85 years we had the most terrible segregation, disenfranchisement. and oppression of former slaves<br\/><br\/>FDR did have a great democratic revolution, capped by a coup against the Court in 1937.  Social Security became constitutional for the first time. Those in their 20s of the greatest generation were inspired by FDR and performed magnificently in World War II.  But their Baby Boom children, the Goldwaterites and McGovernites of the 1960s and 1970s, threw it all away. In dozens and dozens of ways they destroyed the democracy that FDR gave us so that the top 15-20%--the rich-- (themselves) could rule<br\/><br\/>We do, indeed, have a lot of continuity with the system established in 1787 and 1876.","approveDate":"1372995547","recommendations":62,"replies":{"comments":[],"offset":0},"editorsSelection":false,"times_people":1,"sharing":1,"email_status":"0","display_name":"Jerry Fincher Hough","location":"Durham, NC","userComments":"api.nytimes.com\/svc\/community\/v2\/comments\/user\/id\/62195898.xml"},{"status":"approved","commentSequence":152,"userTitle":"NULL","userURL":"NULL","commentTitle":"n\/a","commentBody":"I work for a US company, but right now am on assignment in India, 11 months in with 13 to go.

Jefferson in particular insisted that succeeding generations would have to work out for themselves solutions for their present-day problems, with little regard for what Lincoln called the tired dogmas of the past. The desire so many of us have not only to specify what the Founders intended, but to regard that as sacred text, is utterly antithetical to the spirit of '76, and to the thinking of the Founders themselves, who let's not forget were children of the Enlightenment, as is the U.S. itself.<br\/><br\/>Unlike most of the rest of the world, American nationalism is not and never has been ethnically, but idea-based, ideas best embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, but particularly in the Bill of Rights.<br\/><br\/>Also, it follows that by definition those who regard the federal government as by nature evil are arguably the most un-American of all. Some tea partiers seem not to grasp that American nationalism, the United States itself, is a product of the federal government, that the American people, unlike other countries, did not precede the state and then created one, but was itself a product of the state's creation.<br\/><br\/>Americans have a healthy fear of too strong a government.
