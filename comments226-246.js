I would add to that, most of us spend our day in a cubicle staring at a computer screen. Have taken note lately, most people I observe who are walking, are staring at a hand held phone gadget. Some have the gadget plugged into their ear. I guess this is our holy grail called productivity. One day for hotdogs and potato salad is a welcome relief. Another big key to our resident issues is, as stated, more and more folks live in cities or large metropolitan areas. Ride a train and you will see scores of boarded up small towns , banks , grocery stores, drug stores etc. Gone, no work in many rural areas, and small towns.","approveDate":"1373045411","recommendations":2,"replies":[],"editorsSelection":false,"times_people":1,"sharing":0,"email_status":"0","display_name":"Dan Green","location":"Delray Beach Florida","userComments":"api.nytimes.com\/svc\/community\/v2\/comments\/user\/id\/60338283.xml"},{"status":"approved","commentSequence":225,"userTitle":"NULL","userURL":"NULL","commentTitle":"n\/a","commentBody":"\"Men\" doesn't really mean \"men and women\"!

Since those great leaders made their marks on history, the achievements of Roosevelt, Dr. King, and countless others have brought a measure of justice to working people and minorities that were needed in order to become a more mature and caring society, and continue to evolve this nations courageous experiment in self governance that is now two hundred and thirty seven years old.<br\/><br\/> When I was young, the difference between conservatives and progressives was in how fast to move forward. Now, the situation is weather or not to move slightly forward, or go into headlong retreat. These stark differences, perhaps the most pronounced since the civil war, are hobbling our ability to keep pace with the new realities we face because of climate change, globalization, immigration, and over population. Hesitation in addressing these issues and others is in fact  going backwards, simply by standing still.<br\/><br\/> It's time for an epiphany to jolt Congress out of its wallowing in inaction and make more progress than was realized in negotiating after several months the size of the table with the North Vietnamese.

So many who came in the first and second wave of new emmigrees up through 1919 had a real sense of wanting to give something to this country. Often today I see people who expect this ciuntry to give them certain rights. Rights that once had to be earned are often expected by those who live here and profit here, yet who do not think of America as the place they want to stay. I have seen some use America to be able to acquire what they need in order to go back to their native homes. This is a huge difference from the emigrees of yesteryear.

It is sad that we continue to allow Big Money to determine the course of our nation and our future.  The distribution of the nation's prosperity is not functional for the long term benefit of the whole of our society.  For many reasons that you write about often we cannot seem to correct the unfairness in both incomes and taxes.  And the systems that are really natural monopolies like healthcare and our transport system are not fairing well.  I don't think it is wise to continue the private health care system that we have.  Reports of the costs which have appeared in the times describe an absurdity.  We are foolish to avoid the warnings concerning the global commons:  our atmosphere, oceans, forests, arable lands and water.  Our system for resolving these issues seems to be broken but I am encouraged by your column and optimism that we may emerge from this current mess and have a collectively better future.

Is there still a will amongst us to adapt to those changes? As Dr. K has preached about the hazards of the increasing scarcity of resources, are we ready to accept the fact -- not theory, but fact -- that this nation will never again enjoy the individual standard of living we have experienced since WWII.
