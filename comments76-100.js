The term democracy is thrown around here too easily as it is in more predestine remarks by others. This country is, and has always been, more of a traditional oligarchy than a democracy. This term has tis problems as a description, but it is closer than democracy to what we are, and were. The constitution was designed and written by slave holders, big for the time, business and city machine bosses. There was an almost an invisible number of people who participated in any way, and that continued for most of the history of this country. There was a short time--mostly between 1935 and 1968, a period of a semblance of democracy with the destruction of the Jim Crow South, but that did not last long. This was a period that was called Countervailing Power by John Kenneth Galbraith, but that ended with big business proponents Nixon, Reagan, Bushes, Clinton and Obama; the oligarchs regained control and there is no countervailing power since Unions have been destroyed, and presidents and government serve the interests of business. It is unlikely that anything will change without the elections of Republicans in congress and the president; they already have the supreme court, and begin to implement their scorched earth policies. We will then have a depression that makes the one beginning in 1929 look like prosperity.
