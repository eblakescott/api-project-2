Huzza!<br\/><br\/>To be sure.<br\/><br\/>But there is a downside to urbanization that Republicans, aided by modern technology, have finally figured out pretty definitively.  It's called gerrymandering.  It's no secret that urbanization has a distinctive liberal bias.  The exceptions only reinforce the rule.<br\/><br\/>And with the clustering of liberals in the cities and the near suburbs, it makers it all the easier for Republican state legislatures and governors to ghettoize them into compact voting districts, and then draw serpentine voting district lines which will preserve their power as an electoral majority long after they lost a popular majority.<br\/><br\/>Recall that if Ohio had apportioned its votes by Congressional District in 2012, Romney would have won Ohio 12-6 against Obama, though Obama had 100,000 more votes -- at least according to everyone except Karl Rove.<br\/><br\/>And just in case you thought the Supreme Court might, with some sense of the common good, step in to level the playing field against overreaching minorities, I have five names for you: Roberts, Scalia, Alito, Thomas, and Kennedy.","approveDate":"1373033311","recommendations":4,"replies":[],"editorsSelection":false,"times_people":1,"sharing":1,"email_status":"0","display_name":"arbitrot","location":"nyc","userComments":"api.nytimes.com\/svc\/community\/v2\/comments\/user\/id\/14744029.xml"},{"status":"approved","commentSequence":43,"userTitle":"NULL","userURL":"NULL","commentTitle":"n\/a","commentBody":"We may give lip service to the ideals of democracy, but the continued growth of income inequality, and the de facto growing class differences, are undermining the reality of democracy. We now have at least one political party that caters almost exclusively to the needs of the rich and the corporations that make them rich. And the other party, even though it espouses a form of liberalism, is also beholden in part to the same wealthy and corporate interests. And why is that? Because we have the best government that money can buy, thanks to our insanely expensive elections and to Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United. It seems that, more and more, many people are being manipulated into voting against their own best interests by candidates who really only care about their wealthy benefactors. <br\/><br\/>And lately, the wheels of government have ground almost to a halt. The R's have become proficient at hamstringing the democratic process in Congress. The idea of compromise that allowed our nation to function, albeit not always smoothly, in the past no longer seems to apply. Where will this lead? A non-functional Congress will force the executive and\/or the judicial branches to increase their power to prevent chaos. Does that seem a little like what happened to ancient Rome, in morphing from a republic to an empire overseen by a virtual dictator? Many years ago, I read a book, \"The Coming Age of the Caesars\" that painted an unlikely scenario then, but today it seems more possible.

I also think, that right now, we are in a period where one party is on an ideological joy ride, but that will soon run its course and we will return to trying to solve real world problems with real world solutions.

Yesterday I visited the Denver Botanic Garden. What a beautiful public place. And there are many such places for us to visit and take joy in. Yet I also know that pervasive themes of American history are violence and ignorance, both of which seem in evidence today. I wish that weren't the case, and that uninformed prejudices didn't get in the way of our solving problems, like healthcare, for example, rather than perpetuating them. In other words, I am frequently frustrated with the way things run in this country. On the other hand, it is unfortunately true that things aren't much better elsewhere and frequently worse.
